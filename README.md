Web design for a Food Academy with HTML, CSS and Wordpress. In this case we combined this three design tools to create the perfect website. 
Here we have a homepage with articles that will be upgrading one time at month, and if you go in them you can see the entire information of the cheff, the dishes and the lessons.
On the other hand, in the category called "comer" we can see a "Masonry-effect" made with Javascript.

The web is completely responsive, so has two differents menus. The famous "Burger Menu" for mobile and the classic "Navbar" for desktop.
